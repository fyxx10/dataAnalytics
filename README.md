## Problem Statement

The absence of comprehensive insights into employee data poses challenges for organizations in making informed HR decisions. This project seeks to address this by developing a Strategic HR Dashboard with Power BI and Power Query. The dashboard will analyze employee data, highlighting promotion candidates, at-risk employees, job satisfaction trends, commute distances, years of service, and overtime rates. By providing actionable insights, the dashboard aims to enhance HR decision-making, optimize workforce management, and promote employee engagement.


## This project entails: 

- Loading CSV data into Power BI for analysis.
- Performing data manipulation and transformation using Power Query to clean and prepare the data.
- Creating measures using DAX functions to calculate key metrics and insights.
- Utilizing basic shapes to enhance the visual appeal of the dashboard layout.
- Addressing common errors such as handling 'BLANK' values on the dashboard to ensure data accuracy and clarity.
